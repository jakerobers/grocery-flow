A delicious and flavorful baked chicken dish with a sweet and tangy mustard glaze.

*chicken, baked, main course*

**4 Servings, 1 kg**

---

- *4 tablespoons* olive oil
- *3 tablespoons* honey
- *2 tablespoons* whole grain mustard
- *1 tablespoon* smooth and mild Dijon mustard
- *4 cloves* garlic, peeled and minced
- *1-2 tablespoons* fresh lemon juice
- *1/2 teaspoon* paprika
- *2 pounds* boneless skinless chicken breasts
- *to taste* salt
- *to taste* cracked black pepper
- *2 tablespoons* fresh chopped parsley (optional)
- *to serve* lemon wedges (optional)

---

Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Lightly grease a baking tray with oil and line with foil or parchment paper.

Combine the olive oil, honey, whole grain mustard, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, lemon juice, and paprika in a small bowl and mix well.

Place the chicken onto the prepared baking sheet. Season generously with salt and pepper. Spoon 3/4 of the honey mustard mixture evenly over the chicken and spread it all over each breast. Pour 1/4 cup of water onto the baking sheet to prevent burning and create a sauce while baking.

Bake until cooked through, about 20-30 minutes, depending on the thickness of your chicken breasts. Spoon the remaining sauce over each breast and broil (or grill) for a further 3-4 minutes on medium-high heat to brown the chicken and caramelize the edges.

Cover with foil and allow to rest for 10 minutes to let the juices settle before serving. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately with lemon wedges.
