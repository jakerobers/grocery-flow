- *5* medium sweet potatoes
- *1* 8 oz can tomato sauce
- *1 tsp* garlic powder
- *1 tsp* chili powder

- *1* 16 oz can corn
- *3.75 cups* shredded cheese

Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Scrub the sweet potatoes and pat to dry. Using a fork, poke holes in the sweet potatoes and arrange them on a baking sheet. Bake at 400 for 45-90 minutes until done.

Allow sweet potatoes to cool slightly (about 10 minutes) before slicing them in half lengthwise. Gently scoop out the filling, leaving a small border along the inside of the sweet potato skins. 

Mash together the sweet potato filling with tomato sauce, salt, chili powder, and cumin. Stir in the beans, corn, and ¾ cup of cheese, then spoon the mixture gently back into the skins. Sprinkle with the remaining ¾ cup of cheese.

To bake immediately, bake at 400°F for 10-15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and melted. 

To freeze, cool completely, then wrap in plastic cling wrap and store in a sealed container for up to 3 months. 

To reheat from thawed, unwrap and place in a baking dish. Bake uncovered at 425°F for 15-20 minutes until the cheese bubbles and the potatoes are heated through. For baking from frozen, unwrap and place in a baking dish, cover with foil, and bake at 425°F for 40 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes until the cheese bubbles and the potatoes are heated through.
