Rinse beef stew meat and cut into small bite-size pieces, removing any fat. Season the meat to taste with Rupena's Beef & Pork Seasoning, or use salt, pepper, garlic salt, oregano, and marjoram.

Flour the meat generously and brown it in olive oil in a large kettle or electric roasting pot, stirring often. Once browned, add enough water to cover half of the meat and stew for about 1 hour, stirring frequently.

Add 6 beef bouillon cubes, parsley flakes, the Italian stewed tomatoes, and the chopped onion. Cook on low for 4-5 hours. 

Serve the goulash over wide egg noodles and top with grated Parmesan cheese.
