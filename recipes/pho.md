Start by marinating steak with 1/2 tbsp red curry paste combined with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Set aside. Heat 1 1/2 tbsp of olive oil in a large pot with a fitted lid on medium-high heat. Sauté onion, garlic, and ginger for 5 minutes, until fragrant and softened.

Add the other 1/2 tbsp of red curry paste and sauté for 2 minutes. Add broth and water, bringing to a boil. Add lemon and lime juices, soy sauce, chili paste, and fish sauce. Simmer for 15 minutes with the lid on. During this time, garnishes can be chopped and prepared.

After preparing garnishes and placing them in small bowls so guests can self-serve, heat remaining oil over high heat until it starts to smoke. Cook steak for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until cooked rare to medium-rare (it will cook more in the hot soup). Let rest for 5 minutes, then slice into thin strips.

Bring soup back to a boil and add rice noodles, cooking for 3-5 minutes. If possible, remove noodles from the broth to prevent them from soaking it all up.

Serve pho in large bowls with noodles, broth, and steak, garnishing with chopped vegetables as desired.
