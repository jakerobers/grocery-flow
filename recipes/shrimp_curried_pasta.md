# Shrimp with Curried Pasta

A delightful dish that combines the richness of shrimp with a fragrant curried lime butter sauce, served over fresh fettuccine.

*seafood, pasta, curry*

**4 Servings, 1 lb**

---

- *4 tbsp* unsalted butter, softened
- *1/2* lime (zest and juice)
- *2 tsp* curry powder
- *1/2 tsp* ground ginger
- *to taste* salt
- *to taste* pepper
- *1 lb* large shrimp, peeled and de-veined
- *2 tbsp* vegetable oil
- *2 tbsp* unsalted butter
- *1* small shallot or onion, minced
- *1 cup* chicken or fish broth
- *1 cup* dry white wine
- *1 lb* fresh fettuccine
- *2/3 cup* plain whole-milk yogurt
- chopped green onion (for garnish)
- cashew halves (for garnish)

---

1. Blend the *4 tbsp* butter with the lime juice, zest, curry powder, and ginger. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside to prepare the curried lime butter.
  
2. Heat the oil in a sauté pan over high heat. Add the shrimp and season with salt and pepper. Sauté the shrimp until cooked through, about *4-5 minutes*. Remove the shrimp from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.

3. In parallel, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and boil until tender, approximately *1-2 minutes*. Drain immediately.

4. Add the *2 tbsp* butter to the pan with the shrimp and heat until foaming subsides. Add the shallot/onion and sauté, stirring frequently until translucent, about *2-3 minutes*.

5. Stir in the broth and wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Let simmer until reduced by one-fourth, approximately *4-5 minutes*.

6. Gradually whisk in the curry-lime butter until the mixture is smooth; it may appear broken at first but will come together as it cooks. Cover to keep warm while preparing the pasta.

7. Once the pasta is finished, bring the sauce back to a simmer and whisk in the yogurt. Add the hot pasta to the sauce and lift/toss to coat evenly. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

8. Transfer the pasta to a bowl, top with shrimp, and spoon the remaining sauce over the shrimp. Garnish with chopped green onion and cashew halves.
