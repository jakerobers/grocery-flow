Whisk lime juice, 3 tablespoons water, sugar, fish sauce, 6 tablespoons oil, vinegar, and cayenne together in a bowl; set aside. Pour 2 quarts boiling water over noodles in a bowl and stir to separate. Let noodles soak until soft and pliable but not fully tender, stirring once halfway through soaking, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water until water runs clear, shaking to remove excess water.

Heat remaining 4 tablespoons oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add lower-half green onion, garlic, and salt and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until onion is light golden brown, about 1.5 minutes. Stir in egg and cook, stirring vigorously, until scrambled and barely moist, about 20 seconds.

Add drained rice noodles and toss to combine. Add lime mixture and half of the upper-half green onion, increase heat to medium-high, and cook, tossing gently, until noodles are well coated and tender, about 3 minutes. (If not yet tender, add 6-8 tablespoons water to skillet and continue to cook until tender). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide among individual serving bowls then top with shrimp and bean sprouts and sprinkle with remaining green onion. Serve with garnish as desired.
