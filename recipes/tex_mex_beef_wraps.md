Cut chuck pot roast into 4 pieces

Blend chili powder, cumin, salt, and red pepper. Rub meat all over with spice mixture. Place onion and garlic in the bottom of Crock-Pot slow cooker; top with meat. Spoon 1/2 cup salsa over meat. Cover and cook on LOW for 8 to 9 hours or on HIGH for 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours.

Remove meat from Crock-Pot slow cooker. Shred with two forks. Skim fat from cooking liquid and discard. Return shredded meat to Crock-Pot slow cooker and mix well. Adjust seasonings. Place meat on warm tortillas; top with cheese, tomato, cilantro, and avocado. Roll up to enclose filling. Serve with remaining salsa.
